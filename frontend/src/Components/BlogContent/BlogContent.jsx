        As search engine incumbents — namely Google — amp up their platforms
        with gen AI tech, startups are looking to reinvent AI-powered search
        from the ground up. It might seem like a Sisyphean task, going up

        offers a chatbot-like interface that allows users to ask questions in
        natural language (e.g. “Do we burn calories while sleeping?,” “What the
        least visited country?,” and so on). The platform AI responds with a
        summary containing source citations (mostly websites and articles), at
